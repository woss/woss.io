You use AI coding tools daily. You have thousands of sessions, millions of
tokens, and a stack of model bills. You know you're spending money, but on what?
Which projects? Which models? What's your actual cost breakdown?

[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) stores everything in a SQLite database at
`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`. Every session, message, token count,
model used, cost — it's all there. I decided to play with it and see what I
could build.

[opencode-visualizer](https://github.com/woss/opencode-visualizer) is a
standalone CLI tool that reads that database directly and renders an ANSI
dashboard in your terminal. One binary, zero dependencies, no servers, no data
leaves your machine.

## Installation

```bash
brew install woss/tap/ocv
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/woss/opencode-visualizer
cd opencode-visualizer
deno task compile
./ocv
```

Repository:
[github.com/woss/opencode-visualizer](https://github.com/woss/opencode-visualizer)
Homebrew tap:
[github.com/woss/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/woss/homebrew-tap)

## The Stack

**Deno.** Not Node, not Go, not Rust — Deno. The choice came down to one
feature: `deno compile` produces a single, self-contained binary from TypeScript
source. No bundler, no packaging, no `node_modules`. The compile step embeds all
modules and the Deno runtime into a ~7MB binary (after stripping).
Cross-compilation to Linux ARM64, macOS Intel, and macOS Apple Silicon is a
single flag.

**SQLite.** Direct read-only access via `@db/sqlite`. No ORM, no query builder.
The schema is simple — sessions, messages, parts — so raw SQL with aggregate
functions is the clearest approach. The `int64` flag is essential because
OpenCode timestamps exceed JavaScript's 32-bit integer range.

**Cliffy.** The CLI framework at `@cliffy/command`. I started with manual
`Deno.args` parsing and per-command help functions. After 150 lines of
boilerplate, I nuked it for cliffy's declarative `Command` API. Ten lines per
subcommand, auto-generated help, typed flag parsing with defaults, `--version`
for free. The only CLI framework I've used that reduces code instead of adding
it.

**Pure ANSI escape codes.** This is where it gets interesting.

## The Charting Library That Wasn't

Initial approach: install `termichart`, a Rust-based NAPI-RS terminal charting
library with Dracula themes and sparkline support. Sounded perfect.

Reality: the bar charts rendered as unreadable half-block Unicode patterns —
`▀▄█` noise that looked like a corrupted JPEG. The sparkline was fine, but the
bar charts were indecipherable.

I ripped it out and replaced it with 50 lines of pure ANSI:

```typescript
export function barColored(value: number, max: number, width: number, color: string): string {
  if (max <= 0 || width <= 0) return '';
  const filled = Math.round((value / max) * width);
  const fill = Math.max(0, Math.min(width, filled));
  const empty = width - fill;
  return color + '█'.repeat(fill) + RESET + DIM + '░'.repeat(empty) + RESET;
}
```

Filled blocks in color, empty blocks dimmed. That's it. Reads perfectly, renders
instantly, zero dependencies.

The same approach extends to the dual-colored bars for main vs sub sessions:

```typescript
export function barDualColored(
  mainVal: number,
  subVal: number,
  maxVal: number,
  width: number,
  mainColor: string,
  subColor: string,
): string {
  if (maxVal <= 0 || width <= 0) return '';
  const mainW = clamp(Math.round((mainVal / maxVal) * width), 0, width);
  const subW = clamp(Math.round((subVal / maxVal) * width), 0, width - mainW);
  const emptyW = width - mainW - subW;
  return mainColor + '█'.repeat(mainW) + subColor + '█'.repeat(subW) + DIM + '░'.repeat(emptyW) + RESET;
}
```

Blue for main sessions, cyan for sub-sessions, a legend row beneath the header.
Users can see at a glance which directories have the most delegated work.

## Building the Dashboard

The dashboard layout uses Unicode box-drawing characters (`┌─┬┐│├─┼┤└─┴┘`) with
a two-column split panel:

```bash
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┐
│  ● OpenCode Visualizer   6,540 sessions · 37% active · 25 projects · $21.13  │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────┘
```

Section headers in cyan bold, values in bold white, labels dim. Each panel
section has its own color — green for costs, yellow for models, magenta for
providers, cyan for activity. The color coding creates visual structure without
requiring a graphics terminal.

## CLI Design

```bash
ocv                                             # Dashboard (default)
ocv --help                                      # Show help
ocv stats                                       # Database statistics
ocv dash --top=10                               # Dashboard with top 10
ocv dash --all                                  # Show everything
ocv dash --name=surrealdb-orm,woss.io           # Filter to specific directories
ocv dash --exclude=work-project,internal-tool   # Exclude directories
ocv sessions <path>                             # Sessions for a directory
ocv session <id>                                # Single session details
ocv search <query>                              # Full-text search
ocv rename --from-dir <old> -d <new>            # Batch-rename session directory
ocv overview                                    # Per-directory overview table
ocv stats -o json                               # Any command → JSON with -o json
```

The `--name` flag filters all dashboard panels to specific directories by name.
Works alongside `--exclude` for precise control over what you see.

The `--exclude` flag supports both CLI args and `.ocvignore` files
(gitignore-style patterns at `~/.config/ocv/.ocvignore`). Useful when you have
sensitive directories in your OpenCode history.

Every command outputs JSON with `-o json` (or `--output json`) — making it
pipeable to `jq` for custom analysis.

## Distribution

Single `brew install`:

```bash
brew install woss/tap/ocv
```

Or grab a pre-built binary from GitHub Releases:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/woss/opencode-visualizer/releases/latest/download/ocv-x86_64-linux.tar.gz | tar xz
./ocv
```

Releases are automated via semantic-release. Push a `feat:` or `fix:` commit to
`main`, and the CI workflow:

1. Cross-compiles binaries for 4 platforms (macOS ARM/Intel, Linux ARM/x86_64)
2. Strips debug symbols (73MB → 7.3MB)
3. Publishes a GitHub Release with tarballs
4. A separate workflow in the Homebrew tap repo picks up the release, computes
   SHA256s, and updates the formula

Zero manual steps from commit to `brew upgrade ocv`.

## Architecture Lessons

**No external chart libraries.** Your first instinct is to reach for a charting
library. For terminal output, write the 50 lines yourself. You'll get exactly
what you need with zero dependency overhead.

**Deno compile surprised me.** I expected headaches cross-compiling from macOS
to Linux ARM64. It just worked on the first try. The binary is genuinely
standalone — no runtime, no CLI, nothing but the file.

**SQLite needs no ORM.** I started sketching an entity layer. Wasted time. The
schema has three tables and every query is a GROUP BY aggregate. Raw SQL with
parameterized bindings was cleaner and faster to write than any ORM wrapper
would have been.

**Homebrew taps require zero maintenance.** A Ruby formula with `bin.install`,
`system "deno", "compile"` in the build step, and a cron job to update SHA256
checksums. The tap repo self-maintains via a weekly workflow — I haven't touched
it since creation.

## Similar Projects

The OpenCode ecosystem has sprouted several tools for visualizing usage. Each
has strengths, but they all make trade-offs ocv avoids.

[**opencode-stats**](https://github.com/Cateds/opencode-stats) (Rust/ratatui) —
richer TUI with a 365-day heatmap and share card generation. Well-crafted, but
requires `cargo install`, larger binary, interactive TUI overkill for quick
glances.

[**opencode-usage**](https://github.com/rchardx/opencode-usage) (Python) —
daily/token reports with optional LLM-powered transcript analysis. LLM analysis
is useful but sends data to external APIs. Requires Python + pip, slower
startup.

[**opencode_analytics**](https://github.com/lemantorus/opencode_analytics)
(Node.js/React) — web-based React dashboard with charts and TPS calculations.
Requires local server (`npm start`) + browser.

[**Vis - OpenCode Visualizer**](https://github.com/xenodrive/vis) — web-based,
requires OpenCode server with CORS enabled.

[**tokscale**](https://github.com/junhoyeo/tokscale) (Rust + TypeScript, 3.5k
stars) — most popular: TUI + web + 3D graphs. Tracks OpenCode, Claude Code,
Codex, Gemini, Cursor. Multi-tool scope adds complexity, `bunx tokscale` pulls
from npm.

[**codeburn**](https://github.com/AgentSeal/codeburn) (Node.js) — interactive
CLI for Claude Code spending. `npm install` required, Claude Code only.

[**llmusage**](https://github.com/openrijal/llmusage) (Python) — multi-provider
CLI tracker, unifies data into its own SQLite. Separate import step required.

ocv's differentiators: pure terminal — no browser, no server, no install step
beyond a single binary. Direct SQLite access means zero telemetry, zero network.
One-shot ANSI output that renders instantly and exits. No TUI framework, no
event loop, no interactive mode. Run it, see your data, done.

If you want a zero-dependency, privacy-first, terminal-native dashboard — ocv
is the only choice that fits in one binary.
